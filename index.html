         Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.</p>

            Ghulaman-e-Abbas School is a Trust Owned institution, serving the community since 1958. Itâ€™s a non profit organization for boys from Kindergarten to grade 10 and girls from Kindergarten to grade 5. The vision behind our school is to provide knowledge, learning and high facilities for education to sons/wards of financially deprived families and thereby, improve the quality of life not only of the pupils but the entire families. Keeping this vision in mind, we try our best to ensure that our students not only maximize their academic potential but also become morally responsible and self disciplined individuals equiped with skills for life long learning So that they become successful contributors to their families and society. We strongly believe that our school is the corner stone of a proudly diverse community with highly qualified and dedicated teachers and staff members. We not only support and guide grade 10 students in career selection but also develop such skills which can be helpful to them in providing immediate financial assistance to their families if required.</p><hr>
